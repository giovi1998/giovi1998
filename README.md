During my studies, I had the opportunity to go on Erasmus in Poland, where I spent a semester studying image processing. This experience gave me a unique perspective and allowed me to expand my knowledge in the field of computer science.

Living in Denmark for 7 years has also been a great personal growth experience for me. It has taught me proactivity, adaptability to difficult situations, and how to embrace new perspectives and ways of thinking.
